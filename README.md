# Incremental reinforcement learning in continuous spaces

This repo contains code accompaning the paper: [Zhi Wang, Han-Xiong Li, and Chunlin Chen, "Incremental reinforcement learning in continuous spaces via policy relaxation and importance weighting for dynamic environments", submitted to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2018.]()
It contains code for running the incremental learning domain tasks, including 2D navigation, Reacher, Swimmer, Hopper, and HalfCheetah domains.

The source code is coming soon.
